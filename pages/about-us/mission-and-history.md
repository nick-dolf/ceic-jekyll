    is a grassroots nonprofit that advances equity in the State of Illinois by elevating
    community voices and collaborating with partners to create change in the cannabis
    industry. We fight to make sure the legalization of cannabis in Illinois repairs
    and reinvests in the communities most impacted by the War on Drugs, and to ensure
    the cannabis industry prioritizes people over profits.</p>"

    paragraph: During a series of town hall meetings hosted across the South Side
      of Chicago by Ilinois legislators, community members demanded accountability
      and transparency in the legalization law. This leads to the first Coalition
      meeting at the Port Ministries in Back of the Yards where the group develops
      a list of priorities for legalized cannabis.
  - paragraph: Led by the Coalition, more than 100 people from across Chicagoland
      meet with legislators in Springfield to advocate for equity and justice in the
      legalization bill.
